# Text-Summarization-Model

This repository contains a project to implement **text summarization** using state-of-the-art **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It demonstrates how to efficiently summarize lengthy pieces of text into concise summaries using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## 📌 Overview

With the exponential growth of unstructured data, summarizing lengthy content is crucial for extracting key information efficiently. This project leverages the power of **LLMs** like GPT or similar transformer-based models to generate summaries with high accuracy and coherence.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Pretrained LLMs**: 
  - Integrates transformer-based models like OpenAI’s GPT, Hugging Face’s BERT, or T5.
- **Customizable Summarization**: 
  - Extractive and abstractive summarization options.
- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Handles data cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**: Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.	Clone the repository:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaserselvam/Text-Summarization-Model.git
cd Text-Summarization-Model
```

2.	Run the Jupyter Notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 📚 Usage

1.	Place your dataset in the data/ directory.
2.	Use the **EDA and Preprocessing notebook** to clean and prepare the text data.
3.	Run the **Summarization Model notebook** to generate summaries.
4.	Evaluate the summaries using the provided metrics.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integrate support for multilingual summarization.
- Fine-tune LLMs on domain-specific data for specialized use cases.
- Deploy a user-friendly web application for real-time text summarization.
